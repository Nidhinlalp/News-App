Flutter Clean Architecture Project


Overview


This Flutter project is structured using a clean architecture approach, which separates code into distinct layers to enhance maintainability and testability. Clean architecture helps us isolate business logic from platform-specific code, making the project more modular and easier to maintain.

Project Structure


The project is organized into the following layers:

Domain Layer:



Contains the business logic and use cases.
Independent of any UI, data source, or external dependencies.
Ensures the separation of concerns (SoC) and modularity.


Data Layer:

Manages data sources, including API calls, databases, and external services.
Implements data repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.


Presentation Layer:

Handles the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) components.
Utilizes Flutter for building the app's user interface and state management.


Dependency Injection:

Uses a dependency injection framework like get_it or provider to wire up the application's dependencies and ensure testability.
Testing:

The architecture promotes testability by allowing easy unit testing of domain and data layer components.


UI testing can be performed using Flutter's testing framework.
